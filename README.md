# zkvault-classic

**zkvault-classic** is a zkSNARK-based project designed for learning and educational purposes. It serves as an upgraded version of [`zkvault-basic`](https://github.com/zekele-win/zkvault-basic).

The goal of this project is to build a zk system with **account-level privacy**, using a **Merkle Tree** to manage user state and zkSNARKs to enable private access and verification â€” offering a complete pipeline from proof generation to on-chain verification.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Provide a runnable zk educational project demonstrating how to manage private account state with a Merkle Tree.
- Allow users to privately access account data using zk proofs, without revealing sensitive information.
- Integrate with a web frontend to showcase zk operations within a Web3 DApp context.
